# movie-db-alternative
This repository contains the code for **movie-db-alternative**, a technical assignment project designed to showcase an alternative approach to interacting with movie databases. Built with modern software architecture practices, this project is a proof-of-concept demonstrating how one might fetch, display, and manage movie-related data differently than traditional methods.

**Note:** This project is intended solely for technical evaluation purposes.

## Setting up the **config.properties** file
To integrate with the RapidAPI service, you'll need to set up a config.properties file with the required API parameters.
- Locate the File
    Navigate to the location of the **config.properties** file in your project directory.
- Provide the API Details
    The file should have the following format:
    ```
    base_url=[RapidAPI Base URL]
    api_key=[RapidAPI KEY]
    api_host=[RapidAPI Host]
    ```
    Replace the placeholders with your actual RapidAPI.
